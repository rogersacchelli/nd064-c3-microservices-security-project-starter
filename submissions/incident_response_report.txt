1.Incident commander name
  * Roger Sacchelli

2.Executive summary of what happened
   * High CPU because of cryptomining attack with three pods
    running moneropool, minergate, and unirversal cryptonight.

3.Summary of what was affected
   * The attacker was able to get control of the cluster and run these containers on the cluster. 
   * Attackers are after compute resources to abuse for crypto-mining.  
   
4.Summary of the impact
  * Due to absence of limits, PODs starved cluster capacity affecting all services.

5.Summary of the remediation steps
   * Administrator can kill the pod.
   * Verify on Grafana if CPU load decreases.

6.Summary of lessons learned
    * Restrict access to Kubernetes API Server.
    * Prevent use of unverified images to be deployed.
