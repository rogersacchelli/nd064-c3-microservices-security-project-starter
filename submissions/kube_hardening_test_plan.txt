1. How you will test the changes
Changes can be tested during development and building using tools such Grype to verify vulnerabilties at container layer level.
At the cluster level, kube-bench can be deployed to verify vulnerabilties against industry standards with different types of profiles
like hardened profile. Kube-Bench evaluates both control plane and data plane of pods.

Tests should be done at the appropriate environment to prevent errors on production environment.


2. How you will ensure the changes don't negatively affect your cluster

CI/CD pipeline can prevent unintented changes to damage cluster stability.
Automation can test the changes verified on the code and deliver a test report 
for every build. In addition multiple environments can be set like Development, Testing and Stagging.
